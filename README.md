So many mods, good luck not desyncing!

## Host Installation
*NOTE*: Only the person hosting the server needs to install config, as clients can sync when connecting.

1. Click `Subscribe to all` on the ![Steam](https://i.imgur.com/XEAiSka.png) [Mod Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2315861674) (like and favorite if you choose)
2. Download the [latest config files here](https://github.com/ubergarm/rimworld-mp-kitchen-sink/archive/master.zip)
3. Copy/paste the `Config` and `HugsLib` folders from the zip replacing yours e.g. `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config` or in Linux `~/.config/unity3d/Ludeon Studios/RimWorld by Ludeon Studios/Config`

*NOTE*: You might want to backup your existing `Config` and `HugsLib` folders first!

## Thoughts
A few more mods you could try to add in:
* Hospitality
* Gastronomy
* Rimsec Security

## Issues
If you find something that consistently causes desync issues, please
report it here in the Issue Tracker, or in the collection comments if
you don't have github access.
